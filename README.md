## The Story 📖

So there I was, needing to give my friend a proper telling-off. But WhatsApp? Instagram? Too mainstream. I wanted something with *class*. Something that says "I'm so mad at you that I encrypted my anger with military-grade security."

I found [mdbin](https://github.com/kevinfiol/mdbin) - a nice open-source pastebin - but it wasn't fancy enough for my revenge plot. So I:

1. **Stole it** (legally, it's open source)
2. **Improved it** with my own evil genius
3. **Moved it to Cloudflare Workers** (because I'm already there for my other schemes)
4. **Added encryption** so secure that even the Intelligence Bureau (IB) would be impressed
5. **Finally delivered the roast** with password-protected, PBKDF2-secured curse words

Mission accomplished. Friend properly scolded. Relief achieved. 🎯
